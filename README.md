This project was made by me the in the first year of my engineering college and and we have made this project because Home  automation  allows  to  control  house  appliances  like  door, light, fan, ovenâ€¦ etc. It  also provides  emergency system  and  home  security. It  enables  the  consumer  more  control  of  his home  it  facilitates  many  conditions, for example, if  the  consumer  is  on  his  way   to his  home, controlling  light  turning  on, or pre- heating  oven  when  he  got  home, therefore, many  manual actions  is  replaced  by  home  automation  which   reduce  human  efforts  and  time  saving.

The main objectives of this project  is  to design and to implement a cheap and open source home automation system, that is capable of controlling and automating most of the house appliance through an easy manageable web interface to run and maintain the home automation system.

The proposed system has a great flexibility by using Bluetooth technology to interconnect its distributed modules to home automation server. 

That will decrease deployment cost and will increase the ability of upgrading, and system reconfiguration. System will make use of secure wireless LAN connections between distributed hardware modules and server, and secure communication protocols between users and server.

So how to configure all the eletronic Componets :-

All the parts needed to design  the project are collected and a  primary concept is designed  based on it.

Then
The connection between the  Arduino Nano and the Bluetooth  via the Bluetooth module. After  all the connection is being done,  the Arduino board needs to be  programmed and the Arduino  software has to be installed.

In the end
The Android based mobile  phone is used to control  the Arduino Nano via  Bluetooth
and for the mobile application i have already given you a aia file which you can run on the MIT invetor software or you can also directly run install the apk file which also i have provided.

And if you still have the doubts you can just see the report and the ppt which i have also provide to you.
